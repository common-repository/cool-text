== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q : Demo please...
A : Go to 1. Elegant text : http://osfvad.com/cool_text/elegant_text.htm 2. Crazy text : http://osfvad.com/cool_text/crazy_text.htm 3. Funky text : http://osfvad.com/cool_text/funky_text.htm

Q : How to switch between elegent, crazy or funky text?
A : Take note that elegant text is the default. To change to crazy or funky, open wp-content\plugins\cool_text\cool_text.php, Search for "//Setting : Choose your text", and then look for $cooltextversion. If it is equals to 1, you are choosing elegant text. 2 for crazy text and 3 for funky text.

Q : Will search engines become blind when I use this?
A : No. As you can see, this plugin still publish your normal (the usual) post text (click 'View in normal text format'). This plugin duplicates the normal post text, change the text and publish it (which means your post is published twice, one in normal view and one in the 'cool' text format. By right search engines will not have problem crawling your website.

Q : Some of the converted texts don't appear properly.
A : I noticed this but let me stress to you that in all cases that I have encountered, there is no error in conversion. It is the theme that causes this problem which makes your browser unable to show them properly. Rest assured that this occurs only in small amount of themes. Solution is to change to other themes.

Q : I have my own text list and I want to share it with others. How can I help?
A : Send to my email at support .at. osfvad.com

Q : A small number of my friends / I don't see any of the texts / blank boxes / boxes with funny numbers on it.
A : That means your friends’ / your computer does not support UTF-8 text. Don't worry, it will appear as it should in most computers.

Q : If my friends can't read the text, is there any way they can read my posts?
A : Don't worry, they can always view the normal text version of your posts by clicking 'View in normal text format' button

Q : How can I support this plugin
A : You can link, write, blog about it etc. For default, we made an invisible link back in your website which wont affect you anything. If you want to turn in off, open wp-content\plugins\cool_text\cool_text.php , search for "//Settings : support this plugin" and put 0. If you are feeling generous, you can change to 2 which is visible link back.

Q : Why only blog posts are getting the cool text? How about comments, titles etc?
A : I'm currently figuring that out (look out for the next release). Actually it is harder than it seems. I really appreciate if there is anyone who can solve this coding. Do send me email if you find the solution.

Q : Is this plugin resource hungry?
A : I don't think so unless there is miscoding in your posts. I've tried many different crazy text-html combinations and seem fine until today. If there is any bug etc, uninstall the plugin, contact me and wait until I resolve the issue.

Q : Help, I suspect this plugin jam my server. How to remove this plugin if I cant access the main page of my blog?
A : Dont worry, you can still login as admin at (yourblogurl)/wp-login.php and deactivate the plugin
